# John Newman 💿

## Description 📁

This is the portfolio website for the artist John Newman. It is created with Preact and has a flat minimalist design and setup.

## Branch naming 🌳

```
<type>/<name>
```

### for example

```
feature/feature-name
```

or

```
bugfix/bug-name
```

## Styling 💅

We have different folders for different types of styling.
In the `components` folder we have the styling for the components.
The `components` folder is divided into `atoms`, `molecules` and `organisms`.
A css class we always need to be prefixed with the type of component.
For example:

#### Atom

```
.a-button {
  ...
}
```

#### Page

```
.p-home {
  ...
}
```
